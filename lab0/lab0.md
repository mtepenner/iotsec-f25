This lab was a great introduction to the world of soldering.  I ended up finishing my work at home
due to my time constraints and committments to my job at Intel.  My main technique that I found
was super effective was going side to side with the solder to get the ideal "Hershey's Kiss" appearance
of the solder job.  

The first thing I did was organize all of my tools in front of me so that I could clearly distinguish
components from one another:

I got to work right away after waiting for the solder to heat up to roughly 300 degrees.  
I initially held the solder very awkwardly close to the tip so I constantly
put myself at risk of getting a burn on my palm.

Aaaaand I did suffer a bit as a result of that poor judgement:

I made some progress, and the pins were going in slowly.  I at one point had to de solder, which
proved to be very time consuming and an infliction on my soul as one of the set of pins was super 
crooked and I needed others who were much more experienced to help correct that.

My stopping point at the lab was right about here.  I was able to solder some of the smaller boards
onto the big one.  I carefully put away everything, and ordered my own solder on the way home.

I got my new solder in the mail (Friday the 10th) and finished the job in my garage.  Here are the results:

I'm happy I got it done in time
